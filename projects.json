    "vision": "To democratize institutional-grade revenue management for independent Airbnb hosts, enabling them to maximize earnings without data science expertise.",
    "problem": "Independent hosts lose 15-20% potential revenue due to static pricing. They lack the tools to react to seasonality, local demand spikes, and lead-time booking behaviors.",
    "solution": "Defined the product roadmap for an AI-powered pricing engine. Led the end-to-end development of a Streamlit MVP that utilizes LightGBM to predict booking probabilities. Validated the feature set through competitor analysis of existing property management systems.",
    "impact": "Delivered a functional MVP capable of generating a 15-20% projected revenue uplift for hosts. SHAP analysis confirmed feature interpretability, directly addressing user trust barriers."

    "subtitle": "Clinical Workflow Optimization",
    "link": "https://brain--tumor--segmentation.streamlit.app/",
    "image": "images/brain-tumor.png",
    "vision": "To reduce radiologist burnout and diagnostic delays by automating repetitive image segmentation tasks.",
    "problem": "Manual tumor segmentation takes 20-40 minutes per scan, creating a critical bottleneck in cancer treatment planning. Existing automated tools lacked a user-friendly interface for validation.",
    "solution": "Managed the product lifecycle of a 'Human-in-the-Loop' diagnostic tool. Prioritized a U-Net model backend with a simplified front-end (Streamlit) that allows clinicians to review and adjust masks, balancing automation with medical oversight.",
    "impact": "Achieved a 90% reduction in segmentation time (from mins to seconds) in testing. Validated the UX with non-technical stakeholders to ensure clinical adoptability."

    "image": "images/covid-19.png",
    "vision": "To enable proactive resource allocation for regional health authorities in data-scarce environments.",
    "problem": "Regional policymakers in Zambia were reacting to infection waves rather than preventing them due to a lack of granular, forward-looking data.",
    "solution": "Conducted stakeholder analysis to identify key KPIs (oxygen supply, bed capacity). Developed a forecasting dashboard that synthesized complex time-series data into actionable 'Early Warning' signals for logistics teams.",
    "impact": "Delivered a high-utility MVP under urgent timelines. The tool bridged the gap between raw epidemiological data and actionable logistics strategy, facilitating better resource distribution."
